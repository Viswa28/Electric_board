About Client:

India's leading Electricity board is one of the clients, offering different categories of electricity connections that meet requirements for a wide range of customers.

Problem Statement:

In the modern age of automation and digitalization, the client wants to create a web application for its staff with capability to view and edit the connections made/requested by the user. To solve the problem and get an edge over its competitors, the client wants a Multi- Page User Interface to keep track of applied connections and their status. The application should cover the following aspects:

PART A

1. Display the records in a grid or tabular format.

2. Search option to look for connection details with Applicant ID.

3. Must be able to add a new User.

4. Feature to delete some existing user (optional)

5. Add a date picker to filter by date range via date of application. 6. Option to view/edit electricity connection application requests.

a. Refer dataset for the data attributes. (JSON file will be given... use that in the code for initial)

b. Could be on the same or different page. (optional)

7. Data Validation.

a. Should not be allowed to change the Date of Application, Govt ID Type, and ID

Number.

b. Load applied should not exceed 200 KV.

c. Users only with rejected states can be deleted.

PART B

1. Create a visualization graph e.g., bar or line chart for number of connection requests in every month. (data segregation must be done on the basis of status) The user should be given flexibility to select status (pending, approved etc.) of choice.

2. Pie Chart or any other chart based on imagination (optional) (Use some form of charting library).

Points to Remember:

1. The code should be structured & scalable with proper comments.

2. Ul should be client presentable. Wherever applicable use charting libraries. (UI)

3. Database Services to be used for the storage of data and please follow the normalization principles for creating the Database. (if using Backend... completely

optional and upto preference) 4. Share proper Installation steps/updated README.md file.

5. You are requested to upload your assignment on repositories like GitHub.

6. If not using backend you can store the data in web storages (session storage, loc

storage or web storage) 

7. If doing above step then make sure data should retain in that storage. (if using local storage then added/modified data must not get lost after closing/refreshing the session)

8. Use of Firebase or any other tool is also allowed just make sure to put this in the docs.

9. If desired you can deploy it too.
